In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time using Firebase's Realtime Database even though the code appeared correct and the data was successfully written to the database.  The problem was that the client's cache was not being properly invalidated, leading to stale data being displayed. The solution was to add `keepSynchronized: true` to the database reference to force synchronization.
